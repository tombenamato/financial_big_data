Data must be placed in a separate directory. File location and name should contain metada, e.g. raw data in data/raw, daily/yahoo/IBM.csv
Define function, not random bits of scripts in a notebook
give meaningfull file names
save plots/results to a suitable named directory e.g. results/plots/stylized_facts/price_returns_IBM_daily.png
avoid loops (worst thing in python)


Use parquet (arrow) representation for faster and compressed data, not csv.


Which library?
Polars for in memory computation, numba 
(if gpu needed cupy, then cudf )

Vaex out of memory computation

For all use dask, easy parallelisation and is computation/library agnostic.
